## About the Project

ELEVATE Task is designed to manage tasks, supporting features such as task creation, assignment, and tracking. The front end is developed with Angular to provide a responsive and dynamic user interface. The back-end server is powered by Node.js, serving as the API layer for the application.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: Angular, TypeScript, HTML5, CSS3
- **Backend**: Node.js (Express.js)
- **Package Management**: npm (Node Package Manager)
- **Build Tool**: Angular CLI
- **Version Control**: Git
- **Testing**: Jasmine, Karma
- **Code Quality**: ESLint

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before installing, you need to have the following installed on your machine:

- **Node.js**: Download from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- **Angular CLI**: You can install it globally using npm
  \`\`\`bash
  npm install -g @angular/cli
  \`\`\`
- **Git**: Version control system, you can install it from [here](https://git-scm.com/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   \`\`\`bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   \`\`\`

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   \`\`\`bash
   cd ELEVATE_task-main
   \`\`\`

3. Install the project dependencies:
   \`\`\`bash
   npm install
   \`\`\`

## Project Structure

The project is structured to follow the Angular best practices:

\`\`\`bash
ELEVATE_task-main/
│
├── src/ # Application source code
│ ├── app/ # Angular components, services, models, etc.
│ ├── assets/ # Static assets such as images, fonts, icons
│ ├── environments/ # Configuration for different environments
│ ├── index.html # Application entry point
│ └── main.ts # Main TypeScript file to bootstrap the app
│
├── .editorconfig # Code formatting rules for different editors
├── .gitignore # Specifies files to be ignored in version control
├── angular.json # Angular CLI configuration
├── package.json # Project metadata and dependencies
├── tsconfig.json # TypeScript configuration
├── server.ts # Backend server configuration
└── README.md # Documentation
\`\`\`

## Running the Project

To run the project locally:

1. Start the Angular development server:
   \`\`\`bash
   ng serve
   \`\`\`

2. The application will be available at:
   \`\`\`bash
   http://localhost:4200/
   \`\`\`

### Running the Backend Server

To start the backend server (if applicable):

1. Run the server using Node.js:
   \`\`\`bash
   node server.ts
   \`\`\`

2. The backend server will run on:
   \`\`\`bash
   http://localhost:3000/
   \`\`\`

## Build

To create a production-ready build of the application, run the following command:

\`\`\`bash
ng build --prod
\`\`\`

This will generate the build files in the \`dist/\` directory, optimized for deployment.

## Testing

### Running Unit Tests

This project is set up with **Jasmine** for unit testing and **Karma** as the test runner.

Run the unit tests with:
\`\`\`bash
ng test
\`\`\`

### Running End-to-End Tests

End-to-end tests are configured using **Protractor**. You can run them with:
\`\`\`bash
ng e2e
\`\`\`

Make sure the server is running before executing end-to-end tests.

## Linting

Ensure code quality by running the linter with:
\`\`\`bash
ng lint
\`\`\`

This will scan the source files for any style or code errors as per the linting rules.
